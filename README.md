During this project, I set out to build a driving simulator game within Unity, where the player is swerving through traffic to get to their job on time within 3 minutes. The game includes increasing difficulty with a completed and detailed start screen which includes details on how to play the game, end cinematic to reward the user for winning the game, and lose screen to show the user how close they were to winning the game.
